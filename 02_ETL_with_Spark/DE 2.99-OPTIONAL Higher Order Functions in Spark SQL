# Higher Order Functions in Spark SQL

**Higher order functions** in Spark SQL allow you to transform complex data types, such as array or map type objects, while preserving their original structures. Examples include:

`FILTER()` filters an array using the given lambda function.
`EXIST()` tests whether a statement is true for one or more elements in an array.
`TRANSFORM()` uses the given lambda function to transform all elements in an array.
REDUCE() takes two lambda functions to reduce the elements of an array to a single value by merging the elements into a buffer, and the apply a finishing function on the final buffer.
